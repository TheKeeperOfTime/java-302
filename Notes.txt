---------------------Step 1--------------------------

1. Reflection
Well, I understand that we're just putting security into the app. Making it so only the ADMIN can edit other USERS.

2. What do I understand, or don't.
I don't really know what the service annotation means. I looked it up, but it didn't help me much at all. I understand everything, but that.

3. Question
My only question is about the service annotation. I feel like it's very simple, but that's the only thing that I'm unsure about.

4. App changes
Well, a USER can't edit other USERS, but an ADMIN can. That's pretty much it, unless I missed something.
